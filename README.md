Noble Finances

Noble Finances is a responsive marketing site built with HTML and CSS to showcase services for a fictional tax and bookkeeping firm.

This project is part of my frontend dev portfolio ‚Äî a chance to practice real-world layout, semantic HTML, accessibility, and responsive design. JavaScript interactivity and deployment are in progress.

What It Does (So Far)

- Highlights core financial services with structured content cards
- Features a hero section with a clear call-to-action
- Includes an ‚ÄúAudience‚Äù section tailored to freelancers, families, and small businesses
- Responsive navigation with mobile-first media queries
- Footer with tagline, copyright, and clear links


Tech Stack

- HTML5 (semantic structure + accessibility considerations)
- CSS3 (custom responsive design with styles.css + mediaqueries.css)
- JavaScript (modular file for testimonials interactivity) (Coming soon)
- Git for version control and incremental commits

Why I Built This

- I created Noble Finances to practice building a marketing site directly from a Figma design ([reference design]([url](https://plum-lunar-server.figma.site/)).
- My goal was to translate a static mockup into responsive, accessible, production-ready code. This project gave me a chance to:
- Refine my responsive design workflow
- Match layout and typography closely to the design system

What‚Äôs Next

- Build Testimonials JavaScript: clicking a role on the left will swap in a testimonial on the right with smooth transitions.
- Deploy on Netlify: make the project live with a shareable URL.
- Add service icons with SVG for sharper visuals.
- Add appointment booking form as a stretch goal.
